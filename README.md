# Introduction to Servlets

This repository provides a basic understanding of Servlets, a fundamental technology for Java-based web development. Servlets are Java classes that handle HTTP requests and responses, making them essential for creating dynamic web applications.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Apache Tomcat (or any other application server like JBoss, GlassFish)
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like Eclipse
- Basic knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

### Download and Run Apache Tomcat

1. Download the latest version of Apache Tomcat from the [official website](https://tomcat.apache.org/).
2. Follow the installation instructions for your operating system.
3. Configure Tomcat to work with your IDE (e.g., Eclipse).

### Creating a Dynamic Web Project in IDE

1. Open your IDE and navigate to `File > New > Dynamic Web Project`.
2. Follow the wizard to set up your project.

## What are Servlets?

Servlets are Java classes that extend `HttpServlet`. They are used to handle HTTP requests and responses in web applications. Servlets read data from HTML forms and send data back to the forms.

### Key Features of Servlets

- **Platform Independent**: Servlets are written in Java, making them platform-independent.
- **Efficient**: Servlets can handle multiple requests concurrently.
- **Secure**: Servlets benefit from Java's robust security features.
- **Integration**: Servlets can be integrated with other Java technologies like JSP, Hibernate, and Spring.

### Basic Servlet Example

To create a servlet in Eclipse:

1. Create a new class that extends `HttpServlet`.
2. Override the `doGet` and `doPost` methods to handle GET and POST requests.

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.annotation.WebServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

@WebServlet("/hello")
public class HelloServlet extends HttpServlet {
    private static final long serialVersionUID = 1L;

    protected void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        response.getWriter().append("Hello, Servlets!");
    }

    protected void doPost(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response) throws ServletException, IOException {
        // Handle POST request
    }
}
